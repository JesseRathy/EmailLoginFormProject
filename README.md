# EmailLoginFormProject
A simple login email form (with saving and loading of various types) to understand how these sorts of things work. 


The overall goal of the project is a couple main things:
1. Get more experience in Python (I've already done a lot of Python, but haven't written anything cohesive in it, so I think doing this could be nice
2. Work with Databate types other then SQL, and get more experience in working from them from things like Python including MongoDB
3. Possibly make a UI for it to just play around with UI stuff in Python.
4. Try and do some security stuff with how passwords are stored; Right now they're stored in plain-text, which is definitely a no-go; it'd be interesting to learn some basic security techniques and how to manage those!

Note that this was created in Pycharm and so might be best to open in Pycharm.

MongoEngine and PyMongo are both required  to run this software; Pycharm allows you to install libraries easily through the console and is what this was created on, so it's best to use that if possible
