# EmailLoginFormProject
A simple login email form (with saving and loading of various types) to understand how these sorts of things work. 


The overall goal of the project is a couple main things:
1. Get more experience in Python (I've already done a lot of Python, but haven't written anything cohesive in it, so I think doing this could be nice (and could get me to see why we don't use python for object oriented and GUI type things) 
2. Work with Databate types other then SQL, and get more experience in working from them from things like Python including MongoDB, SQL and other types that may come up to know + be handy
3. Make a UI for it to just play around with UI stuff. Not done Python's UI stuff so it'd be fun to try.
4. Try and do some security stuff with how passwords are stored; they'll currently be stored in plain-text files/on a database, but eventually doing some basic hashing stuff might be cool to do.
